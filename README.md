# Google-Earth-Engine-NDBI
A plot of urban area growth in the city of mumbai and bangalore over the past two decades using the data from Landsat 7/ Landsat 8

A custom polygon variable was used to limit and define the boundaries of a city.

Using Normalized Difference Built-up Index(NDBI) on cloud/artifact free images, during the summer months of each year, we can notice increase in the built up area in a city.

Similar analysis can also be done to plot the change in the vegetative area and change in the size of the water bodies over a period of time using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)respectively
